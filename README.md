# adapt-diagnosticResults

**Diagnostic Results** is a modified version of [adapt-contrib-assessmentResults](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-assessmentResults/) to be used in conjunction with the [adapt-adaptiveContent](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-adaptiveContent) and [adapt-contrib-assessment](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-assessment) extensions.

Most of the functionality is similar to that of the assessmentResults component, so this readme will only discuss the modifications.

If the course has mandatory content, or content that must be completed due to the learner failing a diagnostic question, a continue button will be shown to navigate to the main course.

This component does not have the retry functionailty found in the base assessmentResults component.

### Attributes
